                <h1>One Direction</h1>
                <p class="white">One Direction, British-Irish male vocal group whose stylish good looks and bright
                    pop-rock sound captivated young fans around the world in the early 2010s. The members were Niall
                    Horan (b. September 13, 1993, Mullingar, County Westmeath, Ireland), Zayn Malik (b. January 12,
                    1993, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England), Liam Payne (b. August 29, 1993, Wolverhampton, West
                    Midlands, England), Harry Styles (b. February 1, 1994, Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, England), and
                    Louis
                    Tomlinson (b. December 24, 1991, Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England).

                    The group formed in 2010 on the British television show The X Factor, a talent contest for
                    the
                    act a recording contract soon after the season ended.

                    In the tradition of earlier pop-music “boy bands,” One Direction was promoted as a set of teen
                    idols
                    who were musically compatible but also distinct in style and personality. After building its fan
                    base in early 2011 by touring the British Isles with fellow The X Factor contestants, the group
                    entered the recording studio. The resulting album, Up All Night (2011), filled with cheerily
                    harmonized pop songs about carefree revelry, first-time heartbreak, and other adolescent
                    concerns,
                    was an immediate hit both at home and in other European and Commonwealth countries. Its
                    popularity
                    was fueled in part by the song “What Makes You Beautiful,” a buoyant empowerment anthem that
                    topped
                    the British and Irish singles charts and in early 2012 was named best British single at the Brit
                    Awards (the British equivalent of the Grammy Awards).

                    Although the American market had often bedeviled otherwise popular British boy bands, One
                    Direction,
                    aided by a social media campaign that introduced the group to potential overseas fans, had
                    little
                    difficulty breaking through. Up All Night debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart
                    upon
                    its 2012 release and went on to sell more than a million copies in the United States. The
                    quintet
                    extended its worldwide success with its sophomore release, Take Me Home (2012), which departed
                    little from the winning formula of its predecessor. In 2013 the group was the subject of a 3-D
                    concert-tour documentary, One Direction: This Is Us, and released a third hit album, Midnight
                    Memories. Two years later, while touring in support of the album Four (2014), One Direction
                    announced that Malik had left the group. The remaining four continued to tour but announced a
                    planned hiatus shortly before the release of Made in the A.M. (2015), and the band members began
                    issuing solo albums thereafter.

                <img src="One_Direction_Sydney_6.jpg" alt="This is a real band">
                <p class="white">Styles was raised in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, England, by his parents, Anne Twist
                    and
                    Desmond Styles. His parents divorced when he was seven years old; thereafter, he and his elder
                    sister, Gemma, were raised by their mother. Styles made his start in music while a student at
                    Holmes
                    Chapel Comprehensive School, where he was the lead singer of the band White Eskimo. In 2010,
                    encouraged by his mother, Styles auditioned for The X Factor. For the show, he performed a
                    rendition
                    of “Is She Lovely,” a song originally written by Stevie Wonder. After failing to advance,
                    Styles
                    was recalled and joined with Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, and Louis Tomlinson to compete
                    as
                    a group on the show. The five-member group subsequently became known as One Direction, named at
                    the
                    suggestion of Styles, and ultimately took third place in the final round of the competition. The
                    group released its debut studio album, Up All Night, in 2011. Styles cowrote three songs on the
                    album, which climbed quickly to number two on the U.K. Albums Chart and to number one on the
                    Billboard 200. One Directions next four albums—Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013),
                    Four
                    (2014), and Made in the A.M. (2015)—were all hugely successful.</p>

                <h1>How they achieved their goals</h1>
                <p class="white">In 2016 Styles and the other members of One Direction decided to take a break from
                    recording and touring, enabling Styles to pursue a solo career. That year he signed a contract
                    with
                    Columbia Records and launched Erksine Records, an independent record label. In 2017 he released
                    his
                    debut single, “Sign of the Times,” which topped the U.K. Singles Chart, and his self-titled
                    debut
                    album. His music became known for its combined elements of classic rock, soft rock, and pop,
                    reflecting the many artists by which he was influenced, including the Rolling Stones, the
                    Beatles,
                    Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, Harry Nilsson, and Shania Twain.</p>
